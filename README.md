# Random Biome Generator

A small, browser-based experiment for procedurally generating and visualizing random biomes using noise functions (Perlin noise, white noise, etc.). This repository contains demo pages, styles, and simple JavaScript implementations you can open and run locally.

## Project goals

- Provide a minimal, easy-to-understand implementation of noise-based terrain/biome generation suitable for learning and experimentation.
- Offer interactive demo pages for different noise types (Perlin and white noise...ect) so users can compare results.
- Serve as a starting point for expanding into tile maps, biome logic, biome blending, and exporting generated maps.

## How to run

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open any of the `.html` files in your browser. For example, open `index.html` or `PerlinNoise.html`.

## Usage and controls

Open `PerlinNoise.html` or `WhiteNoise.html` and look for UI controls on the page (sliders, buttons) which may allow changing parameters such as noise scale, seed, or color mapping. If you don't see controls, edit the `.js` files to tweak parameters directly and refresh the page.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. A simple workflow:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (e.g., `feature/add-controls`).
3. Make changes, keep commits small and focused.
4. Open a pull request describing the change and why it helps the project.

If you open PRs, please include a short description of how to test the change locally (which HTML file to open and what to expect).
